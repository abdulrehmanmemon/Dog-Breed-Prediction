# Dog-Breed-Prediction
A neural network using transfer learning 
* Created a tool that estimates the breed of a dog by taking an image of a dog as input
* Scraped over 10.2k files to get this model ready
* The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs
* I have developed a model which predicts the breed from the Dogâ€™s image using the Pretrained Residual Neural Network
* Trained Model : https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/5
